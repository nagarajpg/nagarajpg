Long, long before, when Beelzebub was still existing at home on the planet
Karatas, he had been taken, owing to his extraordinarily resourceful
intelligence, into service on the "Sun Absolute," where our Lord Sovereign
Endlessness has the fundamental place of His dwelling, and there Beelzebub,
with a number of others like himself, had become an attendant upon His
Endlessness.
But then, owing to his youthful and still unformed Reason, as well as to his
callow and impetuous mentation with its unequally flowing associations, that
is, a mentation based on a limited understanding—which is natural for beings
who have not yet become fully responsible—Beelzebub once saw something
in the government of the world that seemed to him "illogical" and, having
found support among his comrades, unformed beings like himself, interfered
in what was none of his business.
Thanks to the force and impetuosity of Beelzebub's nature, his intervention,
supported by his comrades, soon captured all minds and brought the central
kingdom of the Megalocosmos to the brink of revolution.
Having learned of this, His Endlessness, notwithstanding His all-lovingness
and all-forgivingness, was constrained to banish Beelzebub and his comrades
to one of the remote corners of the Universe, to the solar system "Ors," whose
inhabitants call it simply "the solar system", and He assigned as the place of
their existence one of the planets of that solar system, namely the planet
"Mars," with the privilege of existing on other planets also, but only of that
solar system.
